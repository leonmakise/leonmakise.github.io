<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Wuhan University in 2024 under supervision of [Prof. Lefei Zhang](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=BLKHwNwAAAAJ&hl=en) and currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI). I was a research intern at [Horizon Robotics](https://www.horizon.cc/) worked with [Dr. Qian Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pCY-bikAAAAJ) and [Dr. Guoli Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z-25fk0AAAAJ). I was also a visiting student in [LV-Lab](http://lv-nus.org/) at NUS under supervision of [Prof. Xinchao Wang](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=w69Buq0AAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include Vision for Natural Images (All-in-one Restoration), Raw Images (Neural ISP), Autonomous Driving Scene, and Remote Sensing Images (Hyperspectral).

üìß I am open to collaboration and welcome inquiries from anyone interested in my research topics. Feel free to reach out via jiaqi.ma AT mbzuai.ac.ae.

- [Perceive-IR: Learning to Perceive Degradation Better for All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15994)

Xu Zhang\*, **Jiaqi Ma**\*, Guoli Wang, Qian Zhang, Huan Zhang, Lefei Zhang^.

[**Code**](https://github.com/House-yuyu/Perceive-IR), [**Project**](https://house-yuyu.github.io/Perceive-IR/) 

we propose Perceive-IR, an all-in-one image restorer designed to achieve fine-grained quality control that enables restored images to more closely resemble their undistorted counterparts, regardless of the type or severity of degradation.
